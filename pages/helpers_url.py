It is helpful to understand the following definitions when reading this
code.

Directives:

Each possible 'command', such as 'vary_cookie' or 'response_404' is
called a 'directive'.

Blocks:

A 'block' is any set of directives wrapped in [].

There are two blocks here, with three directives in total:
http://simbin.siteladon.com/[meta_noindex+vary_cookie][response_404]/

One of the two blocks above would be selected at random. Directives in a
block are joined with +.

Nested blocks are possible, which introduces randomness within a block.

For example, here there are two outer blocks (one has a nested block):
http://simbin.siteladon.com/[meta_index+[vary_cookie,vary_referer]][response_404]/
